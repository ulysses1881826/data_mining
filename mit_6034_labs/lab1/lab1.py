#### Part 2: Transitive Rule #########################################

# Fill this in with your rule 
transitive_rule = IF( AND( ), THEN( ) )

# You can test your rule by uncommenting these pretty print statements
#  and observing the results printed to your screen after executing lab1.py
# pprint(forward_chain([transitive_rule], abc_data))
# pprint(forward_chain([transitive_rule], poker_data))
# pprint(forward_chain([transitive_rule], minecraft_data))


#### Part 3: Family Relations #########################################

# Define your rules here. We've given you an example rule whose lead you can follow:
friend_rule = IF( AND("person (?x)", "person (?y)"), THEN ("friend (?x) (?y)", "friend (?y) (?x)") )




# Add your rules to this list:
family_rules = [ friend_rule ]

# Uncomment this to test your data on the Simpsons family:
# pprint(forward_chain(family_rules, simpsons_data, verbose=False))

# These smaller datasets might be helpful for debugging:
# pprint(forward_chain(family_rules, sibling_test_data, verbose=True))
# pprint(forward_chain(family_rules, grandparent_test_data, verbose=True))

# The following should generate 14 cousin relationships, representing 7 pairs
# of people who are cousins:
black_family_cousins = [
    relation for relation in
    forward_chain(family_rules, black_data, verbose=False)
    if "cousin" in relation ]

# To see if you found them all, uncomment this line:
# pprint(black_family_cousins)

# Import additional methods for backchaining

def backchain_to_goal_tree(rules, hypothesis):
    """
    Takes a hypothesis (string) and a list of rules (list
    of IF objects), returning an AND/OR tree representing the
    backchain of possible statements we may need to test
    to determine if this hypothesis is reachable or not.

    This method should return an AND/OR tree, that is, an
    AND or OR object, whose constituents are the subgoals that
    need to be tested. The leaves of this tree should be strings
    (possibly with unbound variables), *not* AND or OR objects.
    Make sure to use simplify(...) to flatten trees where appropriate.
